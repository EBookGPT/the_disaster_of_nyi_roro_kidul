This story has potential, but it falls prey to the classic "telling, not showing" trap, leaving the reader feeling distant and uninvolved. Here's a brutally honest critique to push you towards a more immersive experience:

**Problems:**

* **Bland prose:**  "The salty air of Semarang clung to Anya's skin..." This is descriptive, but it's *telling* us about the air, not letting us *feel* it.  Imagine the salty spray on her face, the taste on her tongue, the wind whipping her hair. 
* **Overly expositional:**  We're told about Anya's adventurous spirit, Pak Darto's fear, Mbah Tini's wisdom. But where's the evidence? Show us Anya taking a reckless dive, Pak Darto refusing to let her go out on a stormy day, Mbah Tini whispering ancient secrets in the flickering firelight.
* **Flat dialogue:** "The sea is a fickle mistress, Anya," he'd say... This is functional, but it lacks personality and tension.  Imagine a heated exchange between Anya and Pak Darto, their voices rising, their beliefs clashing.
* **Predictable plot:**  The storm, the box, the curse, the quest to appease the Queen - it feels formulaic.  Subvert expectations, throw in twists, create genuine suspense.
* **Passive voice:** "The fishing nets came up empty..."  Who made the nets empty?  The Queen's curse? A lack of fish?  Make it active! "The Queen's curse had emptied the nets..."

**Constructive suggestions:**

* **Show, don't tell:**  Instead of telling us Anya is adventurous, show her scaling a cliff face, ignoring warnings about dangerous currents.
* **Sensory details:**  Paint vivid pictures with your words.  Describe the feel of the wooden box, the sound of the waves crashing, the scent of incense in the temple.
* **Dialogue with tension:**  Create dialogue that reveals character, advances the plot, and generates emotional impact.  Let the characters clash, argue, even love each other, through their words.
* **Unexpected twists:**  Instead of a predictable curse, maybe the Queen is protecting something, and the villagers are the real threat. Or, maybe Anya's mother isn't actually lost at sea.
* **Inner monologues:**  Give us access to the characters' thoughts and feelings.  What is Anya truly thinking as she holds the box? What is Pak Darto afraid of? 
* **Narrative voice:**  Experiment with different narrative voices.  Perhaps Mbah Tini narrates the story, or Anya's diary entries weave through the chapters.
* **Symbolism:**  The wooden box, the sea, the volcano â€“ use these symbols to create deeper meaning. What do they represent? What do they foreshadow?

**Remember:** Your story is a canvas, and you are the artist.  Use your words to create a world that your readers can experience, not just observe.  Show us the raw power of the sea, the fear of the villagers, and the struggle of Anya to find the truth. 

This feedback is harsh, but it's meant to be constructive.  Don't be afraid to take risks, to experiment, to rewrite and rewrite until your story sings.  The potential is there, waiting to be unlocked.
